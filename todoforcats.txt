To do for cats 4 cats:

landing page on login needs to get data loaded in the view.

Lay out plan:
.use the mini mean store products page as a guide for the who's in heat search. 

.route parameters and how you leverage user id's to load a specific user's profile is a must have


all in all application should be 3 pages by friday(not including login and reg). Home page is a dashboard where you can edit your info (use kitty_modular to help with this)
There should be a page much like the products page in mini mean store that will list all the cats "in heat"

pull header links to the right and give a welcome message

idea for profile pic problem:

profile pic can be picture 0 in an array.
switching your profile pic just makes a different photo index 0 in the array

need to figure out an ng-click for making pictures larger...

show page with own controller

I have created a dashboard routing issue, I am able to see the login view when I am logged in now because I made home a route other than / and now it is the user dashboard essentially. My plan is to use a resolve in the main.js file to check for my rootScope variable before redirecting. 

I am stuck on another routing issue, this time in the backend. I have made a work around for my front end but it cost me a set back in design. I am going to try and retrieve two different arrays of data, the logged in users data and the other users that the logged in user can browse. 

The issue I"m having is that my UserFactory which I created is getting a 404 back on all of it's http requests, including ones that I know work in my services.js...

maybe my landing page should be more general.
