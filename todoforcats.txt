To do for cats 4 cats:
Get nav bar logout button responsive to whether a user is logged in or not.
nav bar will likely need it's own controller

landing page on login needs to be wireframed and started ASAP.
	about me section
	profile questions
	

Users need to have pictures (schema design update)


all in all application should be 3 pages by friday. Home page is a dashboard where you can edit your info (use kitty_modular to help with this)
There should be a page much like the products page in mini mean store that will list all the cats "in heat"

pull header links to the right and give a welcome message

 

idea for profile pic problem:

profile pic can be picture 0 in an array.
switching your profile pic just makes a different photo index 0 in the array

need to figure out an ng-click for making pictures larger...
